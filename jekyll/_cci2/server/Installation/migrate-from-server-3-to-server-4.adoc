Migrating from server v3.x to v4.x is and _in-place_ migration. You will generate a helm-value file, which will be used in a helm command to upgrade the CircleCI server from v3.x to v4.x.

We recommend using a staging environment before completing this process in a production environment. This will allow you to gain a better understanding of the migration process, and give you an idea of how long the migration will take to complete.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

* Your current CircleCI server installation is v3.x.
* You have taken a backup of the v3.x instance, following the instructions on the link:https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-4-operator-backup-and-restore[Server v4.x Backup and Restore Page]. 
** If you are using external datastores, they need to be backed up separately.
** If you are using internal datastores they are backed up using the backup process described in the link above.
* The migration script must be run from a machine with following tools installed:
** link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[kubectl] configured for the server 3.x instance
** link:https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install[yq]
** link:https://github.com/helm/helm#install[helm]
** link:https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff#install[helm-diff]

[#migration]
== Migration

To perform an in-place upgrade of CircleCI server from v3.x to v4.x, you will execute a migration script, which will perform the following tasks:

* Export the KOTS config values into a yaml file.
* Modify the exported YAML file to be used with `helm` to migrate to server v4.x.
* Annotate all the kubernetes resources for `helm`.
* Execute postgres db `domain` migration.
* Execute cleanup steps which will delete all the kots related resources
* Display output message with the next steps

The kots-exporter script can also perform the following functions if required:

* Rerun the annotation step only (`-f annotate`)
* Run the kots-annotation cleanup job (`-f kots_cleanup`)
* Display the output message (`-f message`)
* Rerun the postgresql database migration (`-f flyway`)

[#step-1-create-docker-secret-for-circleci-image-registry]
=== Step 1 - Create docker secret for CircleCI image registry
The migration script requires access to the CircleCI image registry to run the migration function. The image registry is also used in the server v4.x installation. Create the `docker-registry` secret in the same Kubernetes namespace in-which CircleCI server is installed. Image registry credentials will be provided by your CircleCI point of contact. 

In a terminal run the following, substituting all values shown between `< >`:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl -n <namespace> create secret docker-registry regcred \
  --docker-server=<image-registry-hostname> \
  --docker-username=<image-registry-username> \
  --docker-password=<image-registry-password> \
  --docker-email=<notification-email-id>
----

[#step-2-clone-the-repository-and-run-the-kots-exporter-script]
### Step 2 - Clone the repository and run the kots-exporter script
The instructions below guide you through cloning the repository containing the KOTS exporter script. This script generates the `helm-value` file for server 4.x.

. Run `git clone \https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/server-scripts`.
. Change into the `server-kots-exporter` directory: `cd server-scripts/server-kots-exporter`.
. Run the migration script: `./kots-exporter.sh`.
. You will be prompted for the following information:
** Release name of your server 3.x installation - `circleci-server`
** Kubernetes namespace of your server 3.x installation
** License String for Server 4.x, which will be provided by your CircleCI point of contact.
. After the script has completed, you will get a message detailing the next steps to perform, for example:

############ HELM Commands ################
Output file is here - <path>/server-kots-exporter/output/helm-values.yaml

To upgrade Postgres Chart(v11.6.0), follow below steps -
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
export POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace <namespace> postgresql -o jsonpath="{.data.postgres-password}" | base64 --decode)
export POSTGRESQL_PVC=$(kubectl get pvc --namespace <namespace> -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=circleci-server,role=primary -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl delete statefulsets.apps postgresql --namespace <namespace> --cascade=orphan
kubectl delete secret postgresql --namespace <namespace>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Helm Diff command (only changes) -
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
helm diff upgrade <release-name> -n <namespace> -f <path>/server-kots-exporter/output/helm-values.yaml --show-secrets --context 5 <chart-directory>

Helm upgrade command -
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd <chart-directory>
helm dep update
helm upgrade <release-name> -n <namespace> -f <path>/server-kots-exporter/output/helm-values.yaml <chart-directory> --force

NOTE: After server 3.x to 4.x migration, You must rerun the Nomad terraform with modified value of 'server_endpoint' variable
It should be - <domain-name>:4647
----

NOTE: Along with server, the Postgres chart is also being migrated, therefore, the commands detailed in the output message are required.

[step-3-validate-your-helm-value-file]
=== Step 3 - Validate your helm-value file
Check and validate the generated helm value file and modify as required.

[#step-4-generate-helm-diff-output]
=== Step 4 - Generate helm-diff output
Next, execute the helm-diff command and review the output.

[source,shell]
----
 helm diff upgrade <release-name> -n <namespace> -f <path>/server-kots-exporter/output/helm-values.yaml --show-secrets --contexts 5 <chart-directory>
----

Review the output generated from the `helm-diff` command using the following to help:

* line highlighted `Yellow`: Kubernetes resources status, for example, `changed`, `added`
* line highlighted `Red`: Deletion, for example, `image``  
* line displayed in `Green`: Addition, for example, `imagePullSecret`


Below are the changes you should expect to see in `helm-diff` output:

* `imagePullSecrets` is added into all the Kubernetes resources
* Container images are updated
* Secret environment variables (for example api-token, signing-keys) now reference Kubernetes secrets
* Environment variables for RabbitMQ and MongoDB URIs change
* Environment variables for VM, OUTPUT and NOMAD service uri now reference `<domain_name>:<service_port>`
* Annotations from VM, OUTPUT and NOMAD service resources are deleted
* Github checksum is added as annotation
* Secret and annotation for `distributor-*` deployments are deleted
* Upstream chart `postgresql` is updated
* Upsteam charts will be recreated (delete and create):
** prometheus (circleci-server-kube-state-metrics, node-exporter,prometheus-server)
** mongodb
** rabbitmq
** redis (redis-master, redis-slave)

[#step-5-upgrading-circleci-server-3]
=== Step 5 - Upgrading CircleCI Server 3.x
Once your helm-value file is verified, run the following command to upgrade the CircleCI server to v4.x.

[source,shell]
----
helm upgrade <release-name> -n <namespace> -f <path>/server-kots-exporter/output/helm-values.yaml <chart> --force
----

[#step-6-check-upgrade-status]
=== Step 6 - Check upgrade status
Run the following command to check all pods are up and running:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl -n <namespace> get pods
----

[#step-7-update-dns-setting]
=== Step 7 - Update DNS setting
Server 4.x migration is a destructive change for your DNS configuration. There is only one `load-balancer/external-ip` service `circleci-proxy` which you need to update in the DNS configuration.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl -n <namespace> get svc circleci-proxy

# AWS Provider: XXXXX.elb.XXXXX.amazonaws.com
# GCP Provider: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
----

The following Kubernetes service objects are renamed/changed: 

* circleci-server-traefik (LoadBalancer) -> kong (ClusterIP)
* nomad-server-external (LoadBalancer) -> nomad-server (ClusterIP)
* output-processor (LoadBalancer) -> output-processor (ClusterIP)
* vm-service (LoadBalancer) -> vm-service (ClusterIP)

The following Kubernetes service object is added:

* circleci-proxy (LoadBalancer)

[#step-8-execute-nomad-terraform]
=== Step 8 - Execute Nomad Terraform
Execute the link:https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/server-terraform[Nomad Terraform] to re-create nomad client where `server_endpoint` value is set to be `<domain>:4647`. You can follow the steps mentioned link:https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/server-4-install-build-services#nomad-clients[here].

[#step-9-validate-your-migration-to-server-4]
=== Step 9 - Validate your migration to server v4.x

Re-run https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011235534-Using-realitycheck-to-validate-your-CircleCI-installation[realitycheck] on your new server 4.x environment by pushing a fresh commit.

[#step-10-update-your-team]
=== Step 10 - Update your team
Once you have successfully run https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011235534-Using-realitycheck-to-validate-your-CircleCI-installation[realitycheck],
notify your team about the upgrade.
